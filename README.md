# Unity Object Movement

This project allows an object to move towards a specific position in a 3D space in Unity based on x and z coordinates entered from the keyboard.

## How to Use

1. Add the `ObjectMovement.cs` script to your GameObject in Unity.
2. Ensure that your GameObject is positioned within a 100x100 area in your 3D space.
3. Run the game.
4. Enter x and z coordinates from the keyboard, separated by a comma, and press Enter to set the target position for the object.
5. Repeat step 4 to set additional target positions for the object to move towards.
